You wake up. The heat is just promising.

[[When will this ride end?|Aleppo]]

!!Why

Why am I here? Because I am heartbroken.

!!!Who

Doesn&#39;t matter. Yet this great trip was her idea I must admit.

!!!!Me

Am I noone? With no desire and no determination to lead? 

I guess. Maybe. But I did realize this. I did go there. By myself.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Aleppo" tags="" position="670,779" size="100,100">You leave the service taxi.

 The neighbour asks me where I am from. He is interested who am I.

The first one is talking endlessly. The man behind glass can be hardly seen through timetables attached to it. 

I try to bend to get a bit closer to him.

&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;Interrupt her and get the officer&quot;&gt;&gt;
The women in the front ignores me. Other waiting women turn their heads to me, only to get back to squizing around information.

&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;Look into Lonely Planet&quot;&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;Follow the voice&quot; t8n&gt;&gt;
The Harem central bus station is crowded with people and roaring automobiles.
– Iz-mir-iz-mir-iz-mir-iz-mir-iz-mir!!! – another shout nearby.
&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;Walk toward it&quot; t8n&gt;&gt;
I push myself through the crowd. 80 litre backpack is slowing me down. At the same time, people do notice a stranger, and give me way. And stares.
– ...-tep-an-tep-an-tep-an-tep-an-tep-an-tep – station officer continues his sing-along.
This is really confusing and a feeling that I might miss the bus to Syria grows inside me. Some men look at me and try to ask or direct me, but probably assume I&#39;m heading for a tourist destination. I don&#39;t have much time.

Baris tells me that each such stop has a small praying room. 
&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;I want to see it&quot;&gt;&gt;
We go out of the bus and see a small praying building. Inside, there are carpets and simple set of furniture.

I am seated in the very end of the bus, with three other places already taken. 
I squeeze to my place and drink some water.

This ride is going to take all night, crossing through the middle of Turkey. 
Too bad the hangings are closed.

He goes back to Gaziantep, his hometown.

This city was once called Antep, but because of great courage displayed by its population in some war, it received a //Gazi// prefix. It means //Courageos//.

He explais islam to me. So, just like christianity, the essential rule of Islam is to love other people and be good to them.

He has a wife who is also still studying medicine. He is not happy that she can&#39;t cover her head in the university though.

The first one is talking endlessly. The man behind glass can be hardly seen through timetables attached to it. 

I try to bend to get a bit closer to him.

&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;Interrupt her and get the officer&quot;&gt;&gt;
The women in the front ignores me. Other waiting women turn their heads to me, only to get back to squizing around information.

The Harem central bus station is crowded with people and roaring automobiles.
– Iz-mir-iz-mir-iz-mir-iz-mir-iz-mir!!! – another shout nearby.
&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;Walk toward it&quot; t8n&gt;&gt;
I push myself through the crowd. 80 litre backpack is slowing me down. At the same time, people do notice a stranger, and give me way. And stares.
– ...-tep-an-tep-an-tep-an-tep-an-tep-an-tep – station officer continues his sing-along.
This is really confusing and a feeling that I might miss the bus to Syria grows inside me. Some men look at me and try to ask or direct me, but probably assume I&#39;m heading for a tourist destination. I don&#39;t have much time.

The ancient, walled old town is still divided into three parts.

I am seated in the very end of the bus, with three other places already taken.

I meet Baris.

Baris tells me he is a doctor.
He goes back to Gaziantep, his hometown.

He asks me what I am doing here?

– I am a tourist. I&#39;m going to Syria.
&lt;&lt;case 2&gt;&gt;
Baris doesn&#39;t speak arabic. Arabic is not very popular in Turkey. 
I ask him, if they read the Quran in arabic, or turkish? 
In arabic. 

– This is very strange, how can you even understand it?

– Imam can explain it!

&lt;&lt;case 3&gt;&gt;
This city was once called Antep, but because of great courage displayed by its population in some war, it received a //Gazi// prefix. It means //Courageos//.

I ask about the war. It was against the french.
&lt;&lt;case 4&gt;&gt;
He explais islam to me. So, just like christianity, the essential rule of Islam is to love other people and be good to them.

He has a wife who is also still studying medicine. He is not happy that she can&#39;t cover her head in the university though. In Turkey, in the university, you cannot display your religion like this.
&lt;&lt;default&gt;&gt;
Baris teaches me some words in turkish and arabic. I&#39;m very sleepy.

Yet hot air squizzing through the window frame announced how merciless the morning sun will be.

It is a hilly area, dry, yellow, brown. The bus descends into the valley and stops at the outskirts, &quot;Gaziantep Otogarı&quot;.

Now, according to my notes, I should find some transportation to the border town of Kilis.
&lt;&lt;if $known[&#39;basir&#39;]&gt;&gt;Baris already left, but told me to find a //service taxi// in Kilis. They are shared taxis that go through the border straight to Aleppo.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;The station has big, digital list of destinations, and Kilis is one of them&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;.

Go to [[Kilis]].

Everything is white and dusty.

It was just an hour drive, but I feel really tired now, and hungry for breakfast.
&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;Check my bag for food&quot; t8n&gt;&gt;
There are just a rolled pitas bought in Istanbul. Now pretty dry. No more fruits, nor other things. It&#39;s good I still have water.

The //serveees taxis//, as they call them, are here.

– Fifty dollar – says one of them.
